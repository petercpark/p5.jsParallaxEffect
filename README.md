# p5.js Parallax Effect
P5.js Parallax Effect is a project of mine that just does the parallax on mouse move effect with using nothing but p5.js

All of the code is in the [sketch.js](https://github.com/petercpark/p5.jsParallaxEffect/blob/master/sketch.js) file

Keep in mind that these are the code for the website so make sure to replace the file names and edit it to suite your needs
